Description: Implement a ride-sharing application with the below-expected features.

Features:
- The application allows users to share rides on a route.
- Users can either offer a shared ride (Driver) or consume a shared ride (Passenger).
- Users can search and select one from multiple available rides on a route with the same source and destination.


Requirements:
1. Application should allow user onboarding.
    - add_user(user_detail)

2. Add basic user details
    - add_vehicle(vehicle_detail)

3. Add the user’s vehicle(s) details

4. User should be able to offer a shared ride on a route with details.
    - offer_ride(ride_detail)
    - Ride will have details like vehicle, origin, destination, available seats. (A ride will have no intermediate stops.)

5. Users can select a ride from multiple offered rides using a selection strategy. (A user can only request a ride (only for 1 or 2 people))
    - select_ride(source, destination, seats, selection_strategy)
    - Preferred Vehicle (Activa/Polo/XUV)
    - Most Vacant.

6. System should be able to end the ride. User can only offer a ride for a given vehicle, once there are no active offered rides for that vehicle.
    - end_ride(ride_details)

7. Find total rides offered/taken by all users.
    - print_ride_stats()

Bonus Question:
8. If the user’s origin/destinations are not available directly but it’s possible via multiple rides,
then the application should output multiple rides. (Example: for input: Bangalore to Mumbai, the output can be Bangalore to Goa and Goa to Mumbai)


Sample Test Cases:

- Onboard 5 users
add_user(“Rohan, M, 36”); add_vehicle(“Rohan, Swift, KA-01-12345)
add_user(“Shashank, M, 29”); add_vehicle(“Shashank, Baleno, TS-05-62395)
add_user(“Nandini, F, 29)
add_user(“Shipra, F, 27”) ; add_vehicle(“Shipra”, Polo, KA-05-41491); add_vehicle(“Shipra, Activa KA-12-12332”)
add_user(“Gaurav, M, 29)
add_user(“Rahul, M, 35); add_vehicle(“Rahul”, “XUV”, KA-05-1234);

- Offer 4 rides by 3 users
offer_ride(“Rohan, Origin=Hyderabad, Available Seats=1, Vehicle=Swift, KA-01-12345, Destination= Bangalore”)
offer_ride(“Shipra, Origin=Bangalore, Available Seats=1, Vehicle=Activa KA-12-12332, Destination=Mysore”)
offer_ride(“Shipra, Origin=Bangalore, Available Seats=2, Vehicle=Polo, KA-05-41491, Destination=Mysore”)
offer_ride(“Shashank, Origin=Hyderabad, Available Seats=2, Vehicle=Baleno, TS-05-62395, Destination=Bangalore”)
offer_ride(“Rahul, Origin=Hyderabad, Available Seats=5, Vehicle=XUV, KA-05-1234, Destination=Bangalore”)
offer_ride(“Rohan, Origin=Bangalore, Available Seats=1, Vehicle=Swift, KA-01-12345, Destination=Pune”)

This call should fail, since a ride has already been offered by this user for this vehicle.

- Find rides for 4 users
select_ride(“Nandini, Origin=Bangalore, Destination=Mysore, Seats=1, Most Vacant”)
2(c) is the desired output.

select_ride(“Gaurav, Origin=Bangalore, Destination=Mysore, Seats=1, Preferred Vehicle=Activa”)
2(b) is the desired output

select_ride(“Shashank, Origin=Mumbai, Destination=Bangalore, Seats=1, Most Vacant”)
No rides found

select_ride(“Rohan, Origin=Hyderabad, Destination=Bangalore, Seats=1, Preferred Vehicle=Baleno”)
2(d) is the desired output

select_ride(“Shashank, Origin=Hyderabad, Destination=Bangalore, Seats=1,Preferred Vehicle=Polo”)
No rides found

- End Rides
end_ride(2-a)
end_ride(2-b)
end_ride(2-c)
end_ride(2-d)

Find total rides by user: Rides Taken: Rides that have were taken and have been marked as “ended”
Rides Offered: Rides that were offered and have been marked as “ended”.
Note: Even if the offered ride was not taken by any user, it counts as an offered ride.

- print_ride_stats()
Nandini: 1 Taken, 0 Offered
Rohan: 1 Taken, 1 Offered
Shashank: 0 Taken, 1 Offered
Gaurav: 1 Taken, 0 Offered
Rahul: 0 Taken, 0 Offered
Shipra: 0 Taken, 2 Offered
