Description
Flipkart is taking initiatives in opening a chain of libraries. It is initially starting a library in Bangalore.
Based on the response, it may take this initiative further. You need to create a backend system to maintain the functionality of the library.


Functional Requirements
- The users can register and take membership of the library for a certain period of time.
- There are n different books available in the library and each book having a certain number of copies.
- A registered user with active membership can borrow a book from the library.
- A user can hold upto 2 books at a time.
- One user can not hold two copies of the same book together.
- A book has to be returned within 30 days or before the membership end date, whichever is earlier.
- A user can return the book at any point of time. Beyond the due_date, a fine of Rs 1 is applied for a day.
- A user can view his/her current details along with the book history borrowed by him/her.
- A user can check the list of available books.

Bonus
- Implement a system where a user can donate book(s) to extend his/her library membership validity.
  Consider that donating a book will extend the membership by 90 days.

For simplicity, assume that the initial inventory is already present in the system
